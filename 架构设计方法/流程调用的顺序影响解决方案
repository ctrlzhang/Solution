for example, creating a guest account in user service and get access token from authorization service.
- we don't check token
- call user serviece first, but authorization service failed, in this case, access token is not created, but it is critical for the upcoming flow, 
so we think this step is failed, client user needs to retry.
- call authorization servier first, but user service failed, in this case, account is not created, and it is critical for the upcoming flow, so 
we think it is failedd, client user needs to retry
- create account needs to be idempotent


login
- we don't check token
- call user service first, but authorization service is failed, in this case, token is not created, so it is failed, client user needs to retry.
- call authorization service first, but user service is failed, in this case, user has not login, so it is failed, client user needs to retry.
- login needs to be idempotent

register
- we don't check token
- call user service first, but authorization service is failed, in this case, token is critical for the upcoming flow, so client user needs to retry
